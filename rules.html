                            The GC50 Virtual Challenge is being held to commemorate the GC community’s Golden Jubilee. To celebrate our 50th year, we have made the event more engaging and inclusive as compared to our usual Uphill Runs. We have moved our physical challenge to the virtual space due to COVID-19 restrictions, but at the same time expanded our invitation to include almost 10 times our usual participation numbers! Participants in GC50 Virtual Challenge work together to achieve 50,000km in 50 days together, and at the same time competing in leaderboards, earning awesome digital badges for themselves, while keeping fit!
